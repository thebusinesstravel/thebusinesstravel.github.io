			<h2> LET YOURSELF GO</h2><br>
			<p>We connect any brand with travelers and travel sellers all along the travel advertising ecosystem. Become the preferred choice for travel consumers when they are in an active state of mind; planning or enjoying their trip.<br> <br>
			A specialized travel ad network that manages the Ads on Amadeus sites, platforms, documents and partner’s channels.  
            At the Travel Advertising unit, we provide versatile, travel-intelligent advertising services that facilitate Advertisers and Publishers alike to achieve their goals.<br> <br>
			Although we are starting to see business travel return, and we can all agree that business is better in real life, it is important to recognize the lasting impact COVID-19 will have on business travel moving forward.  We have the opportunity to not just rebuild business travel, but to rebuild it better. But how? By delving deeper into discovering what travelers really want. That’s why over the last 12 months, we commissioned three global traveler surveys to understand traveler sentiment during this unique time.
